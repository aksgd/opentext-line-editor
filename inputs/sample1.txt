Imagine that you are writing a piece of scientific software,
and you need to calculate prime numbers up to a certain 
limitâ€”as we did in the previous chapter. You have
a nice algorithm to calculate them, so you copy and paste 
it to wherever you need. 
One day, though, your friend, B. Riemann, gives you a better algorithm
 to calculate primes, which will save you a lot of time. 
At this point, you need to go over your whole code base and replace the old code with the new one.
